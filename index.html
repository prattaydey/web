	<h2> Origins </h2>
	<p> Canadian-born <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Naismith">James Naismith</a> invented an early form of basketball during his time as a physical education professor at a YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. During the harsh New England winter of 1891, he sought an indoor sport that he could use to keep his students occupied and active through the long season. After creating a primitive form of today's basketball and deciding the basic rules of the game, he nailed a peach basket (hence the name BASKET-ball) to the balconies of the gymnasium and had his students play in teams of nine with a soccer ball.

		At this point, Naismith's sport would be mainly unrecognizable to a fan of today's basketball. However, as the game spread quickly through the global network of YMCAs, more and more ideas and regulations were implemented to make it the complex game it is today. It's hard to believe but dribbling and dunking, which are one of the most unique parts of basketball, were originally restricted in games until years later. In addition, the use of a peach basket as the original hoop was inconvenient as the bottom was not hollow, therefore requiring a person to manually remove it every time the ball went into the basket. While the game-ball initially looked more like a round football, removing the laces and coloring it orange allowed viewers to see the ball more clearly and for the further development of dribbling with its new symmetrical shape. This was the start of basketball's journey from a simple winter activity to one of the most popular sports in the world.

	<h2> The Basics </h2>
	<p> Basketball is a team sport with five positions: 
		<ul>
			<li> Point Guard
			<li> Shooting Guard
			<li> Small Forward
			<li> Power Forward
			<li> Center
		</ul>
		
		The main goal of basketball is to score as many points while trying your best to prevent your opponent from doing the same. Players score a point for their team by shooting a ball through their defender's hoop. In leagues, games are timed and whoever has the most points once time's up is the winner. However, in less competitive or "official" games such as street basketball, the games are untimed and have a point limit that is set beforehand - whoever reaches or passes this point limit first wins the game.

	<h2> Appeal/My Experience </h2>
	<p> I grew up watching NBA games on TV with my older brother and cousins, who all helped me get into basketball. We would have countless arguments over which player was better than another or which team would win that night and I think the competitiveness helped bring us closer together. Growing up in NYC, where you can find a court nearby almost anywhere, it was a convenient hobby that was fun, free, and a healthy alternative to staying home all day in front of a screen (much like we do now). I think this is one of the main reasons basketball and other sports such as soccer are popular. With the construction of new courts every year, all you really need is a ball to play.
